# graphs-trees

Task 10.4.
Write a function that finds the minimum value in the BST tree and returns a pointer to a node (or NULL) as a result.
Link minimum(Link root);

Task 10.5.
Write a function that finds the maximum value in the BST tree and returns a pointer to a node (or NULL) as a result.
Link maximum(Link root);

Task 11.2.
Write a program that reads a graph and prints it out as an adjacency list.

The first line of input contains two numbers, w, k (representing the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively). The graph is undirected.

The program should print n lines as an output. Each line contains the vertex number and all the vertices on the adjacency list.

Example:

Input

5 6

1 2

1 3

1 4

2 4

2 5

4 5

Output

1 2 3 4

2 1 4 5

3 1

4 1 2 5

5 2 4

Task 11.3
Write a program that reads a graph and performs a breadth-first traversal (BFS)

Task 11.4
Write a program that reads a graph and performs a depth-first traversal (DFS)
